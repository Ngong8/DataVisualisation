Introduction: (The project starts from June 27th)
This is my hobby project for making the data visualisation desktop application, primarily visualising the input data from a csv file on web, which is about the whole Malaysia accumulated cases from year 2020 to the present year(2021 as of now), as the output to the eyes of the people.

The program is written in Python programming language, with , currently showing bar chart for now. You can select a bunch of states/federal territories and range of dates for viewing the visualised output.

ATTENTION:
There are some values which are labeled as 0, this is either because some of the data are omitted where as it should contained in that csv file, or it could be also you select the range of date which is the data haven't released yet or too far from the current date.
